### Pipeline

Now let's run the same in the pipeline. The pipeline is triggered by a file change under a branch and a pull request, what is controlled by a Terrateam GitHub extension. To trigger the pipeline execute following steps:

1. Create a branch with name: your_name/day-2_ops4. Add your name or other unique string the branch name.

2. Change variable file to provide any change.

3. Commit with message "trigger day-2_ops4"

4. Push branch

5. Create a pull request

Open the pull request at https://github.com/rstyczynski/terrateam-gitops to see that the plan operation is being executed.

```text
terrateam plan: day-2_ops4 default Waiting for status to be reported â€” Running
```

Once it's completed click on `Expand for plan output details` under pull request conversation comment's `Terrateam Plan Output` to see ansible execution plan.

```text
```

TODO: comment of the plan phase.

To execute the play send apply command to the pipeline

```bash
terrateam apply
```

Once executed you see that the play ran successfully.

```text
```

Your playbook logic was executed, and the execution context is stored at the Terrateam server. Drop all changes, because we do not want to push them to the repository, by closing the pull request and deleting a branch.

> **Note:** In regular situation, after a successful apply, you will merge and delete the feature branch to ensure all related files are in the `main`. In your local repository you will switch back to the main branch and pull the latest changes.
